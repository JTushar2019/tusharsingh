Work of this week

- Read Jerrin's thesis first 4 chapters, and slides, regarding classification of Phonological thesis and decoding imagined words. 
- Read "Experiments Procedure" section from "Inferring imagined speech using EEG signals", the paper where Jerrin's data comes from, to understand the recorded data.
- Made some notes regarding feature extraction and network architecture.
- Received Jerrin's reply on Thursday regarding only Matlab code suggestion for a feature extraction procedure. Since I write in python. so i have to build up code from scratch for everything.
- have planned some code work-flow and will be implementing it this week. 
- have downloaded the data-set used in Jerrin's thesis, and had to spend some time unpacking it without errors.
- have written EEG data loading generic function which loads and labels EEGs by their corresponding imagined words and also maintains patient Ids for future use.
