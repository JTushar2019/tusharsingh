Weeks Work

Monday:
Read "Sub-band Mean Phase Coherence for Automated Epileptic Seizure Detection" to understand the used feature.
Implemented Data Augmentation function for specified Sliding Window
Implemented MPC (Mean Phase Coherence) feature extraction
Implemented MSC (Magnitude Squared Coherence) feature extraction
Implemented alpha beta gamma band extractor for EEG's.


Tuesday:
Implemented EEG MPC_MSC image maker as proposed by Jerrin's Thesis (Done)
Learnt some pytorch as I have only used TensorFlow in the past
As feature extraction is time intensive(1.7 sec per 1 sec EEG) so i have decided to pre-process the EEG's and store them first and then feed it into PyTorch.
Implemented the above in parallel processing(AI server has 96 cores lying ideal) way to speed up the feature extraction.
Implemented custom Detest, and Data-loader class for PyTorch


Wednesday:
Got some issue with python environment, installed and configured Anaconda.
Figuring out way to split data for training testing and validation through PyTorch.
Learning PyTorch from PyTorch Pocket Book Reference by O'Really.
Built ResNet pre-trained architecture as Jerrin's Thesis with PyTorch.
Started Training. With few rounds of iteration, training acc increases up to 85 but testing stays at almost chance.
I have planned to implement it in TensorFlow as there i have much experience in tweaking learning and weight initialisation strategies.
